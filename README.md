### 4. How to Use Your Spins Effectively

Now that you’ve got your 5000 free spins, it’s important to use them wisely to get the most out of your offer. Here are a few tips for using your spins effectively:

- **Focus on Collecting Coins First**: In the early stages of the game, you’ll want to use your spins primarily for earning coins to upgrade your village. A good tip is to play the slot machine until you’ve collected enough coins for several upgrades.

- **Time Your Spins During Events**: Coin Master frequently holds events that can boost your rewards when you use spins during the event period. If there’s an event, try to use your spins to maximize the rewards you can earn during that time.
